# Modules Folder

All files in this folder should be moved into separate node modules. However, those files
use native ES6 modules (import / export statements) instead of the CommonJS approach
used by NodeJS so far (module.exports= {} / require('â€¦')). 


**Interesting links related to the problem:**

For the time being, all files are written as plain standard ES6 modules, relying on Babel
to resolve everything properly.
